## Project Description

This web application is an AI assistant that allows the user to cluster study material like a textbook or notes. It allows the user to view those documents going line by line and stepping in and out to different materials to the relevant sections within those materials like a debugger. If you do not have enough source, the app will provide the user relevant websites. The AI chat at the side can provide clear summaries about the page/subject highlighted by the user.
